The purpose of the project is to design and develop a CNC Router Integrated Electrospinning Collector System that ensures precise and reliable linear motion along the X-axis to improve the adjustability  of the drum collector of the electrospinning. The system is specifically aimed at addressing the challenges associated with automated biomedical applications by integrating mechanical and electronic components, such as a stepper motor and ball screw mechanism, while utilizing Arduino-based programming for adaptability and user-friendly control.
